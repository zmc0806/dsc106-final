> In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices, nodes, or points which are connected by edges, arcs, or lines.
> -- <cite>Wikipedia</cite>

D3 Graph Theory is a front-end project aimed at anyone who wants to learn graph theory. It provides a quick and interactive introduction to the subject. The visuals used in the project makes it an effective learning tool.
